## About Me, with a Guessing Game  
In this website I mentiond a biography about me and I created 5 yes or no questions so the user can get to know me as a website owner better. Then I extend the game by creating a gussing number game with 4 attempts and 6 attempts to guess something about me using an array.

**Reflections and Comments**
- overall, this is going fine so far.
- I do not have any question about what we have learned actually I am wondering what we will learn and how the final product or website will be? I'm very exciting.
- I thought this will take days and it took me almost 5 hours to finish it.
