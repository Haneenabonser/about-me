## About Me, with a Guessing Game  
In this website I mentiond a biography about me and I created 5 yes or no questions so the user can get to know me as a website owner better.

**Reflections and Comments**
- overall, this is going fine so far.
- I do not have any question about what we have learned actually I am wondering what we will learn and how the final product or website will be? I'm very exciting.
- I thought this will take two days but it took me less than two hours to finish it. I don't know if that is a long time or not but I know that I'm happy and proud.
