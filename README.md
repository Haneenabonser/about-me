## About Me, with a Guessing Game  
In this website I mentiond a biography about me and I created 5 yes or no questions so the user can get to know me as a website owner better. Then I extend the game by creating a gussing number game with 4 attempts and 6 attempts to guess something about me using an array. Finally, I add some CSS features to make this website look nice.
